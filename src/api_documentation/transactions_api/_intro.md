Authentication
==============

The API uses OAuth to validate access. The OAuth Token can be passed in
two ways. The first way is to pass the OAuth Token in the header of the
request. The second is to pass the OAuth Token like any other query
parameter. Please note that the OAuth Token is a required parameter.
OAuth Tokens may be generated from the Manage API Credentials page.
